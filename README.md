🎥 How It Works
Landing Page → Click Try it out.
Start Camera → Allow webcam access.
Capture → Grab a snapshot from the live video feed.
Send → Image (Base64) is POSTed to Lambda via API Gateway.
Lambda → Uses Rekognition to match the face, logs presence in DynamoDB.
Response → UI displays Attendance marked or Face not recognized.
