🎥 How It Works
Landing Page → Click Try it out.<br />
Start Camera → Allow webcam access.<br />
Capture → Grab a snapshot from the live video feed.<br />
Send → Image (Base64) is POSTed to Lambda via API Gateway.<br />
Lambda → Uses Rekognition to match the face, logs presence in DynamoDB.<br />
Response → UI displays Attendance marked or Face not recognized.<br />
